# My AI Projects Hub

Welcome to my collection of AI and machine learning projects! This repository is a central place where I document my work, linking to projects hosted externally (like Kaggle). It’s designed to be simple, clean, and easy to expand as I grow my skills.

## About This Repository

This isn’t your typical code-heavy repo. Instead, it’s a showcase of my experiments with AI, featuring:
- Links to projects on platforms like Kaggle.
- Brief descriptions of what I built.
- Personal notes on what I learned.

## Why I Built These Projects

I’m passionate about AI and how it can solve real-world problems. Starting with chatbots, I’m exploring natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning to understand how machines can interact with humans. Each project is a milestone in my learning journey.

## Future Plans

Here’s what I’m working toward:
- Experimenting with more advanced NLP models.
- Adding small demo files or screenshots to this repo.
- Building a multi-language chatbot.
